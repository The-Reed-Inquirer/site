    '269 unique institutions': "Exactly 269 unique domain servers received the threat, which likely approximates almost exactly to the number of institutions targeted. However, it is possible for a single institution to have multiple web addresses. Both northwestern.edu and qatar.northwestern.edu received the threat, for example, but represent different campuses of the same institution.",
    'indicating that those addresses were compiled and added to the target list from some reference list other than IPEDs.':"This is highly unusual, since almost every ranking or list of colleges in widespread use references IPEDs in some way. Sources that compile institution names and contact emails in a manner inconsistent with IPEDs are few and far between, making them easy to identify with enough information to perform a reverse search, which this finding provides.",
    'were distinct from those targeted in the same batch as Reed':"This would bring the total number of institutions targeted to over 500.",
    '*Formatting preserved':"This style — new line breaks that don't follow sentence structure but keep the width of each line roughly equal — is very unusual in prose writing, but very common for programmers or anyone writing in a plain text (.txt) editor. As described below, this is one of several indications that the message may have been written in a code editor and programmatically sent.",
    '[redacted]':"In the original repository, @hoppuman has here provided what appears to be his full name and home address, although the Inquirer has not attempted to verify this. It is not reproduced here, as it has little news value, and it is this reporter's sense that, while the information is public, reprinting it would constitute an unwarranted invasion of @hoppuman's privacy.",
    'orange links':"In annotations, for example, I may even use first person pronouns."

                <p>Reed’s Office of Community Safety alerted campus early Wednesday, March 13, that the college had received an 
                    emailed threat of explosives and an accompanying shooting on campus. The threat was received by more than 
                    200 institutions across the United States, and Director of Community Safety Gary Granger stated that “we 
                    have no reason to believe that Reed is specifically being targeted.” Reed Community Safety alerted the 
                    Portland Police Bureau upon receiving the threat, and assured the Reed Community that the PPB was responding 
                    to the matter. At this time there have been no further developments to suggest that the threat was credible.</p>

                <p>“The communication was distributed to more than 100 admissions offices across the United States, alerting them 
                    to the reported presence of four fertilizer-based explosive devices,” Director Granger wrote Wednesday, “two on 
                    campus premises (with one concealed underground), one within a vehicle, and another in possession of an unidentified 
                    individual. The identity of the person who disseminated this information remains unknown.”</p>

                <p>The emailed threat, a copy of which Director Granger provided to reporters for the Quest and the Inquirer, 
                    was sent at 4:03 AM Wednesday to 301 email addresses associated with college admissions departments across 
                    the U.S. The message originated from a user identified as “AustralianHitler@dnmx.org.” Dnmx is an anonymity-focused 
                    email provider which, on <a href="https://dnmx.org/">its website</a>, describes itself as “The Anonymous Email Service 
                    For The Dark Net.”</p>

                <p>The threat message itself, a copy of which can be found <a href="bomb-threat-story/threat-message_original.pdf">here</a>, read:</p>

                <div class="quote-block">
                    <p>Four fertilizer-based explosives. Two around campus (one is buried), one <br>
                        in my car, and one on me. As soon as I detonate the first three, it's guns <br>
                        blazing. If law enforcement manages to trap me then the fourth one on me <br>
                        goes kaboom. I'm hoping for a high kill count today!*
                        </p>
                </div>

                <p><a class="note">*Formatting preserved</a></p>

                <p>In an email to reporters, Director Granger assessed the credibility of the threat as low, emphasizing the number 
                    of institutions targeted and the vague nature of the message. “Even in a high-risk environment (i.e., a 
                    place/organization that might be a high value target for a person or group), the vast majority of threats 
                    are simply that,” Director Granger wrote. “And, the vast majority of actual attacks using explosives have 
                    no warning provided. If a very specific organization or facility is targeted for threats, it is possible 
                    that someone is trying to gain intelligence about their response, but this threat was not against high value 
                    targets, nor specific. Moreover, the author wrote that they would be on site. Since this was sent to over 
                    200 institutions, the credibility is pretty low. I don't believe we at Reed are at any increased risk.”</p>

                <p>“However,” Director Granger continued, “in my 40+ years of dealing with bomb threats one [thing] has been 
                    true across time: one always responds as if the threat may be credible because not to do so invites a 
                    potentially avoidable disaster.”</p>

                <p>By isolating the domain names hosting each targeted email address, the Inquirer was able to identify the 
                    websites of all institutions to receive the threat message. Reporters were then able to cross reference 
                    the targeted domains with the federal Integrated Post Secondary Education Dataset (IPEDS) — a sprawling 
                    government database of U.S. colleges — identifying the names and street addresses of the institutions 
                    targeted, and by extension their latitudes and longitudes.</p>

                <p>Overall, approximately <a class="note">269 unique institutions</a> in 48 U.S. states or territories received the threat message. 
                    Of these, 252 had domain names with valid matches in the IPEDs database. The remaining seventeen did not, 
                    however, <a class="note">indicating that those addresses were compiled and added to the target list from some reference list other than IPEDs.</a></p>
            
                <p>Using Google Reverse search, reporters were able to verify that the seventeen unusual addresses appeared in a public file 
                    called <a href="https://github.com/hoppuman/TikTokHacks/blob/master/AskForShirts/colleges.txt">colleges.txt</a>, which contains a list of 1,717 colleges and their admissions email addresses. Of the 301 email addresses to 
                    receive the threat, 300 appear exactly in colleges.txt. Exactly one, the admissions email address for <a href="https://www.rgu.ac.uk/">Robert 
                    Gordon University</a> in Ireland, does not.</p>

                <p>While the Inquirer has been unable to verify whether the colleges.txt source file was used to compile the list of 
                    targeted email addresses, it is hosted alongside an open source Python program, “<a href="https://github.com/hoppuman/TikTokHacks/blob/master/AskForShirts/sendmail.py">sendmail.py</a>,” which appears 
                    designed to solicit free t-shirts by sending mass emails to college admissions addresses. The program is hosted 
                    in a <a href="https://github.com/hoppuman/TikTokHacks">public GitHub repository</a> titled “TikTokHacks,” which appears to have been created by the TikTok influencer 
                    <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@hoppuman">@hoppuman</a>, who uses the same username on both platforms.</p>

                <p>A sample message provided alongside the Python program reads:</p>

                <div class="quote-block">
                    <p>Dear [CollegeName] Admissions,</p>
                    <p>I am a TikToker named Hoppuman (430,000 followers). I'm working on a project where I promote schools and universities based on their college tshirts! <br>
                        If you would like your college promoted I would love to show it on my page (past episodes in this series have gotten 1M+ views). <br>
                        If you're willing could you please send your best school shirt to:
                        </p>
                    <p>James Hoffman <br>
                        PO Box 160634 <br>
                        Brooklyn, NY 11216
                        </p>
                    <p>Thank you, <br>
                        James
                        </p>
                </div>

                <p>Late Wednesday, a local Fox 65 station in Kentucky <a href="https://fox56news.com/news/local/asbury-university-among-200-schools-to-receive-bomb-and-shooting-threat/">reported that</a> nearby Asbury university had received an emailed 
                    threat of “multiple bombs on campuses and that there would be an active shooter threat.” The university, Fox 
                    reporter Madylin Goins wrote, “was one of 200 colleges and universities that received bomb and shooting threats on 
                    Wednesday.” </p>

                <p>Asbury’s contact email address does not appear in the threat message received by Reed, but does appear in the 
                    TikTokHacks GitHub repository. The Inquirer reached out to Fox 65 with its findings in an attempt to confirm 
                    whether the threat message received by Asbury used the same language as the one received by Reed, and whether 
                    the 200 colleges referenced <a class="note">were distinct from those targeted in the same batch as Reed</a>, but did not receive a 
                    response in time for publication.</p>

                <p>The threats came the same day that the U.S. House of Representatives voted overwhelmingly in support of the so-called 
                    “TikTok ban,” a bill that would force Chinese parent company ByteDance to sell TikTok within six months or face a 
                    ban of the app on U.S. soil. The bill now faces a difficult road to approval in the Senate, per a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/13/technology/tiktok-ban-house-vote.html">New York Times 
                    assessment</a>, but President Biden has said he would sign it into law if passed. The Biden administration has long 
                    argued that Chinese ownership of TikTok “poses grave national security risks to the United States, including the 
                    ability to meddle in elections,” but some lawmakers — and many TikTok users — have opposed the bill on free speech 
                    grounds. It was not immediately clear if there was any connection between the timing of the threats and the House vote.</p>

                <p>This is a developing story, and the Inquirer will continue to follow it as more information becomes available.</p>

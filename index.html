            </div>
            <div class="content-block">
                <p>The Reed Student Body Senate announced Wednesday it will conduct an advisory referendum during the next Student Body 
                    Election, currently scheduled for mid-April. The Senate will also add two new senators to that body, with a ninth to 
                    be elected in Spring 2024 and a tenth in Fall 2024.</p>
                <p>Senate Election Liaisons Lily Garvey and Andrew Sakahara confirmed in an email to the student body that the topic of the 
                    referendum will be announced “after nominations close” on April 8 at 11:59pm.</p>
                <p>The referendum was added to the ballot by an 8-0 vote of the Senate, according to the liaisons.</p>
                <p>As reported by the <i>Quest</i> on March 29, Senate Secretary Taylor Barthes confirmed that the referendum “is solely at the 
                    request of the Senate and is not a result of processes outlined in Article 3, Section 4 or Article 4 Section 1 of the 
                    Community Constitution or the result of decisions made by Election Czars.”</p>
                <p>Typically, as described in the <a href="https://www.reed.edu/governance/community-constitution/#iii.-section-4.-legislative-actions">articles of the Community Constitution cited by Barthes</a>, student referendums are held to 
                    facilitate the “creation, revision, or abolishment of community-wide legislation,” and are initiated either by the 
                    Senate in response to a vote of the faculty, or by a petition of 20% of enrolled students, faculty, or staff.</p>
                <p>There is no mention of an “advisory referendum” in the <a href="https://www.reed.edu/governance/community-constitution/">Community Constitution</a>. Similarly, no references to referendums — 
                    advisory or otherwise—appear in either the <a href="https://the-reed-inquirer.github.io/site/documents/senate_bylaws.pdf">Senate Bylaws</a> or <a href="https://the-reed-inquirer.github.io/site/documents/election_handbook.pdf">Student Body Elections Handbook</a>. It is unclear what procedure 
                    the Senate used to add the referendum to the ballot, or if they are empowered to do so under the available governing 
                    documents.</p>
                <p>The Student Body Senate did not respond to a request for comment.</p>

                <p>Reed’s Office of Community Safety <a href="bomb-threat-story/emergency-notification_original.pdf">alerted campus</a> early Wednesday, March 13, that the college had received an 
                    <a href="bomb-threat-story/threat-message_original.pdf">emailed threat</a> of explosives and an accompanying shooting on campus. The threat was received by more than 
                    200 institutions across the United States, and Director of Community Safety Gary Granger stated that “we 
                    have no reason to believe that Reed is specifically being targeted.” Reed Community Safety alerted the 
                    Portland Police Bureau upon receiving the threat, and assured the Reed Community that the PPB was responding 
                    to the matter. At this time there have been no further developments to suggest that the threat was credible.</p>

                <p>“The communication was distributed to more than 100 admissions offices across the United States, alerting them 
                    to the reported presence of four fertilizer-based explosive devices,” Director Granger wrote Wednesday, “two on 
                    campus premises (with one concealed underground), one within a vehicle, and another in possession of an unidentified 
                    individual. The identity of the person who disseminated this information remains unknown.”</p>

                <p>The emailed threat, a copy of which Director Granger provided to reporters for the <i>Quest</i> and <i>The Inquirer</i>, 
                    was sent at 4:03 AM Wednesday to 301 email addresses associated with college admissions departments across 
                    the U.S. The message originated from a user identified as “AustralianHitler@dnmx.org.” Dnmx is an anonymity-focused 
                    email provider which, on <a href="https://dnmx.org/">its website</a>, describes itself as “The Anonymous Email Service 
                    For The Dark Net.”</p>

                <p>The threat message itself, a copy of which can be found <a href="bomb-threat-story/threat-message_original.pdf">here</a>, read:</p>

                <div class="quote-block">
                    <p>Four fertilizer-based explosives. Two around campus (one is buried), one <br>
                        in my car, and one on me. As soon as I detonate the first three, it's guns <br>
                        blazing. If law enforcement manages to trap me then the fourth one on me <br>
                        goes kaboom. I'm hoping for a high kill count today!*
                        </p>
                </div>

                <p><a class="note">*Formatting preserved</a></p>

                <p>In an email to reporters, Director Granger assessed the credibility of the threat as low, emphasizing the number 
                    of institutions targeted and the vague nature of the message. “Even in a high-risk environment (i.e., a 
                    place/organization that might be a high value target for a person or group), the vast majority of threats 
                    are simply that,” Director Granger wrote. “... Since this was sent to over 
                    200 institutions, the credibility is pretty low. I don't believe we at Reed are at any increased risk.”</p>

                <p>“However,” Director Granger continued, “in my 40+ years of dealing with bomb threats one [thing] has been 
                    true across time: one always responds as if the threat may be credible because not to do so invites a 
                    potentially avoidable disaster.”</p>

                <p>By isolating the domain names hosting each targeted email address, <i>The Inquirer</i> was able to identify the 
                    websites of all institutions to receive the threat message. Reporters were then able to cross reference 
                    the targeted domains with the federal <a href="https://nces.ed.gov/">Integrated Post Secondary Education Dataset</a> (IPEDS) — a sprawling 
                    government database of U.S. colleges — identifying the names and street addresses of the institutions 
                    targeted, and by extension their latitudes and longitudes.</p>

                <p>Overall, approximately <a class="note">269 unique institutions</a> in 48 U.S. states or territories received the threat message. 
                    Of these, 252 had domain names with exact matches in the IPEDs database. The remaining seventeen did not, 
                    however, <a class="note">indicating that those addresses were compiled and added to the target list from some reference list other than IPEDs.</a></p>
            
                <p>Using Google Reverse search, reporters were able to identify that the seventeen unusual addresses appeared in a public file 
                    called <a href="https://github.com/hoppuman/TikTokHacks/blob/master/AskForShirts/colleges.txt">colleges.txt</a>, which contains a list of 1,717 colleges and their admissions email addresses. Of the 301 email addresses to 
                    receive the threat, 300 appear exactly in colleges.txt. Exactly one, the admissions email address for <a href="https://www.rgu.ac.uk/">Robert 
                    Gordon University</a> in Scotland, does not.</p>

                <p>While <i>The Inquirer</i> has been unable to verify whether the colleges.txt source file was used to compile the list of 
                    targeted email addresses, it is hosted alongside an open source Python program, “<a href="https://github.com/hoppuman/TikTokHacks/blob/master/AskForShirts/sendmail.py">sendmail.py</a>,” which appears 
                    designed to help users solicit free t-shirts by sending mass emails to college admissions addresses. The program is hosted 
                    in a <a href="https://github.com/hoppuman/TikTokHacks">public GitHub repository</a> titled “TikTokHacks,” which appears to have been created by the TikTok influencer 
                    <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@hoppuman">@hoppuman</a>, who uses the same username on both platforms.</p>

                <p>A <a href="https://github.com/hoppuman/TikTokHacks/blob/master/AskForShirts/Message.txt">sample message</a> provided alongside the Python program reads:</p>

                <div class="quote-block">
                    <p>Dear [CollegeName] Admissions,</p>
                    <p>I am a TikToker named Hoppuman (430,000 followers). I'm working on a project where I promote schools and universities based on their college tshirts! <br>
                        If you would like your college promoted I would love to show it on my page (past episodes in this series have gotten 1M+ views). <br>
                        If you're willing could you please send your best school shirt to:
                        </p>
                    <p><a class="note">[redacted]</a></p>
                    <p>Thank you, <br>
                        James
                        </p>
                </div>

                <p>The program also comes with a manual, "<a href="https://github.com/hoppuman/TikTokHacks/blob/master/AskForShirts/READ%20THIS%20FIRST.txt">READ THIS FIRST.txt</a>", which instructs users to "edit Messages.txt to change the message you want to send." The manual includes a disclaimer that "I am not responsible for all the mail you will get because of this."</p>

                <p>Late Wednesday, a local Fox 65 station in Kentucky <a href="https://fox56news.com/news/local/asbury-university-among-200-schools-to-receive-bomb-and-shooting-threat/">reported that</a> nearby Asbury university had received an emailed 
                    threat of “multiple bombs on campuses and that there would be an active shooter threat.” The university, Fox 
                    reporter Madylin Goins wrote, “was one of 200 colleges and universities that received bomb and shooting threats on 
                    Wednesday.” </p>

                <p>Asbury’s contact email address does not appear in the threat message received by Reed, but does appear in the 
                    TikTokHacks GitHub repository. <i>The Inquirer</i> reached out to Fox 65 with its findings in an attempt to confirm 
                    whether the threat message received by Asbury used the same language as the one received by Reed, and whether 
                    the 200 colleges referenced <a class="note">were distinct from those targeted in the same batch as Reed</a>, but did not receive a 
                    response in time for publication.</p>

                <p>The threats came the same day that the U.S. House of Representatives voted overwhelmingly in support of the so-called 
                    “TikTok ban,” a bill that would force Chinese parent company ByteDance to sell TikTok within six months or face a 
                    ban of the app on U.S. soil. The bill now faces a difficult road to approval in the Senate, per a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/13/technology/tiktok-ban-house-vote.html">New York Times 
                    assessment</a>, but President Biden has said he would sign it into law if passed. The Biden administration has long 
                    argued that Chinese ownership of TikTok “poses grave national security risks to the United States, including the 
                    ability to meddle in elections,” but some lawmakers — and many TikTok users — have opposed the bill on free speech 
                    grounds. It was not immediately clear if there was any connection between the timing of the threats and the House vote.</p>

                <p>This is a developing story, and <i>The Inquirer</i> will continue to follow it as more information becomes available.</p>

            </div>
            <div class="content-block">
                <p>Hi, I’m Declan Bradley, a former reporter and editor of the <i><a href="https://reedquest.org/">Reed College Quest</a></i> and <a href="https://www.declanrjb.com/">six-time nationally award winning student journalist</a>. I cut my teeth reporting 
                    Senate Beat my first semester at Reed, and spent the next year editing the paper. Last December, I made 
                    the personal decision to withdraw from the reelection race to protect my own mental health, having been 
                    greatly disturbed by the ongoing messages I received regarding my coverage of <a href="https://www.declanrjb.com/portfolio/wotc_protest/final.html">student protests</a>, which 
                    arrived at all hours of the day and night, including to my personal phone number. Stepping away from the 
                    paper was the right decision for me then, and I haven’t written for the <i>Quest</i> since.</p>

                <p>However, journalism is my passion, and I believe in the importance of data-based, investigative reporting. 
                    This leaves me with something of a dilemma. I want to write news, but the new <i>Quest</i> editorial board have 
                    implemented policies I disagree with, and which make it difficult for me to have confidence in the integrity 
                    of my own work. These are, to name a few:</p>

                <p>1. Barring online breaking news coverage, and restricting all news stories to align with the seven day print publication cycle. </p>
                <div class="quote-block">
                    <p><b>My concern:</b> The news doesn’t always align itself with the Friday print schedule, no matter how much we want it to. 
                        In cases like that of the recent bomb threat, when solid, informative reporting published quickly can be the 
                        difference between anxiety and reassurance for on-campus students, I believe breaking news is vital. (Note, it was 
                        my intent for this story to be published last week, in the immediate aftermath of the bomb threat. The delay was 
                        due primarily to the time it took to build this site, for which I apologize.)</p>
                </div>

                <p>2. Failure to commit to writer right of review.</p>
                <div class="quote-block">
                    <p><b>My concern:</b> It was always my policy as an editor to guarantee that no reporter or writer would ever be 
                        surprised by what appeared under their byline. No reporter should ever have to worry about words being 
                        put in their mouths without their knowledge or permission. Unfortunately, I 
                        have witnessed this happen at least twice this semester, once in a news story, and while the editors have 
                        made some effort to correct those mistakes, I am not confident in their continued commitment to guaranteeing 
                        writers the right to review their own stories before publication. As a student journalist who cares deeply 
                        about my own work, I am unwilling to take that risk.</p>
                </div>

                <p>I’ve covered why I feel unable to report for the <i>Quest</i>, but what will this site do that’s new(s)? 
                    I’ll start with what it won’t do. No opinion. No editorials, or reviews, or games, or charts, or entertainment 
                    columns. All things that have real value, and certainly have a place in a newsroom, but don’t have a place here. 
                    This site will do one thing: hard news. I anticipate that will usually take one of the following forms:</p>
            
                <ul>
                    <li>Breaking News</li>
                    <li>Investigative reporting</li>
                    <li>Data-based coverage, usually investigative</li>
                </ul>

                <p>The attentive reader will note that two of these are not currently published by the <i>Quest</i>, with one being 
                    explicitly forbidden by current editorial policy, and the third is published by that paper only rarely. 
                    That’s intentional. I have no desire to compete with the <i>Quest</i>, which still employs several reporters I respect.</p>

                <p>Now, down to the nitty gritty. These are the policies I intend to obey going forward. They closely mimic the 
                    policies that the <i>Quest</i> followed last semester, which is again intentional. I reserve the right to alter these 
                    policies as this project evolves, but will post a notice if I do so.</p>

                <ol>
                    <li>The mission of <i>The Inquirer</i> is to report the truth, without fear or favor.</li>
                    <li>Other contributors to this project are welcome, provided that they are Reed community members (students, 
                        staff, faculty, etc), and that they adhere to these policies.</li>
                    <li>Anonymity will be granted to sources if and only if they are suffering a credible risk of real and 
                        immediate harm. (Sources in high risk situations are encouraged to contact me on Signal encrypted chat (<a href="https://signal.me/#eu/QgONqQLRFOCz_pGyWCK7e_5uwNoD5TrrkXmCc5vZRYilHKp9TIxFfI6fsYDs6voN">@declanrjb.42</a>), 
                        and of course no source will ever have their name printed without their explicit permission. If in doubt, 
                        contact me.)</li>
                    <li>Letters to the Editor are of course accepted, provided that they:
                        <ul>
                            <li style="font-size: 1em;">Pertain in some way to coverage published on this site.</li>
                            <li style="font-size: 1em;">Are signed, no anonymous letters.</li>
                            <li style="font-size: 1em;">Are addressed to me, by name. (Given that I’m the only person who works here, the <i>Quest</i> standard, “Dear editor,” seems a bit grandiose.)</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>All other forms of newspaper writing — including but not limited to opinion and entertainment writing — 
                        are distractions from the mission of this site, and will not be published.</li>
                    <li>In cases where <i>Inquirer</i> reporting includes a data science or programming aspect, all code and raw data files 
                        will be made open source and published alongside the story. (Thank you to <a href="https://themarkup.org/">The Markup</a> for inspiring this practice.)</li>
                </ol>

                <p>Since this site has a specialized mission, it will also have a specialized format. Source files for 
                    each story can be accessed through the <i class="fa-brands fa-github"></i> Source button above the headline. 
                    <a href="http://www.reedinquirer.org">Blue links</a> reference either external sites or documents obtained by 
                    <i>The Inquirer</i>. Click on <a class="note">orange links</a> to view annotations with additional information 
                    and details about the reporting process. 
                    Typically, plain text will be written in traditional formal news style, while annotations will 
                    follow a more informal, explainer journalism style.</p>

                <p>I’ll leave you with what I consider to be the watchwords of this site, the key tenets of its coverage and 
                    what it exists to accomplish. <i>The Inquirer</i> is:</p>

                <table class="tenets-table">
                    <tr>
                        <td class="table-word">Fast</td>
                        <td class="table-description">Breaking news, as it happens.</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td class="table-word">Accurate</td>
                        <td class="table-description">The truth, without fear or favor.</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td class="table-word">Agile</td>
                        <td class="table-description">Willing to embrace the future of news and adapt to a changing landscape.</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td class="table-word">Streamlined</td>
                        <td class="table-description">The news, and nothing but the news.</td>
                    </tr>
                </table>

                <p>This is the <i>Reed Inquirer</i>. Let’s get to work.</p>
